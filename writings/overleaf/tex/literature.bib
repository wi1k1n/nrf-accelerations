abstract = {The study of the physical process of light interacting with matter is an important
part of computer image synthesis since it forms the basis for calculations of intensities
in the picture. The simpler models used in the past are being augmented by more complex
models gleaned from the physics literature. This paper is another step in the direction
of assimilating such knowledge. It concerns the statistical simulation of light passing
through and being reflected by clouds of similar small particles. (It does not, however,
address the cloud structure modeling problem). By extension it can be applied to surfaces
completely covered by dust and is therefore a physical basis for various theories
of diffuse reflection.},
