\section{Basic models and knowledge}

Not very long about very basics
Laying out why the following sections are relevant for this work

\subsection{\{Rendering equation\} \im{or/and radiometry?}}
\begin{enumerate}
    %\item Color space \im{?}
    \item LDR/HDR
    \item Rendering equation
    \item Transfer equation
    \item (simple) volume rendering
    \item BSSRDF + Reflection Models
\end{enumerate}

\sm{Not sure how relevant that is. Maybe put this in a subsection later for NeRF? Lowest priority for now.}

\subsection{Camera model}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Homogenous coordinates
    \item Pinhole camera model
    \item Intrinsics
    \item Extrinsics
    \item Distortion
\end{enumerate}


\section{Neural scene representation}

\sm{sounds like a good listing}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Explicit/implicit scene representations
    \item Neural Radiance Field (Scene Representation Networks, Local Light Field Fusion ..->.. NeRF)
    \item Positional encoding (Fourier Features Let Networks Learn...) % How it is performed and what for? The background research behind this.
    \item NeRF optimizations (NSVF, FastNeRF, KiloNeRFAutomatic Integration and others)
    \item Rendering under novel lighting conditions (NRF, DRF, Deep Voxels, NeRD, NeRV, NeRFactor etc)
\end{enumerate}
