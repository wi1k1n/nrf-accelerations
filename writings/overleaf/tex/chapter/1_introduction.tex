The task of reconstructing a real 3D scene from a set of 2D captured images
and modeling it under novel viewing and light conditions
is a long-standing problem in computer graphics and vision.
Possible complex scene geometry along with numerous material qualities
make this task a tremendously challenging problem.

The applications of realistic rendering include diverse fields, such that
visualization, animation, virtual and augmented reality, visual effects,
and even computer vision and robot navigation.

This task was traditionally addressed to the image-based rendering systems,
which use vision-based scene geometry together with image-based view interpolation. \cite{shumandkang2000}
However, recent works in this field make use of deep neural networks
in order to learn implicit "neural" scene representation,
containing both geometric and appearance information. \cite{tewari2020state}

\cite{mildenhall2020nerf} presented a state-of-the-art approach,
which uses deep neural network as an implicit scene representation
along with a ray-marching technique. 
This technique has quickly become a starting point for a lot of other works. \im{short list of main works here}
However, the main limitation for most of them is the lack of light interaction,
which disables the novel light conditions for the rendering scene.

% \section{Goal of the Thesis}
The goal of this thesis is to develop a solution
that is able to model scene geometry and appearance
with view- and light-dependant effects
implying colocated as well as non-colocated light sources.
This is done by utilizing sparse voxel octree approach,
proposed in \cite{liu2021neural} for increasing the performance.
\cite{bi2020neural} proposes the




% \section{Outline}
In Chapter 2 related background along with already existing methods are described.

Chapter 3 is dedicated to the proposed method.

Chapter 4 describes and analyses the experiments and the results.
