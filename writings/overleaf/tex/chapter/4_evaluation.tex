This chapter addresses implementation details, experiments, ablation studies and achieved results.



\section{Training and validation data}

Each training session consists of optimizing parameters of a separate neural representation from one of proposed methods.
The dataset for each training session is created on one specific scene and with one specific light setting.
All of used datasets have been created in an artificial environment using Blender \cite{blender}.
Each dataset consists of rendered RGB images of the scene.
Each image is an HDR image (the OpenEXR \cite{openexr} format is used to store HDR data on disk).
The dataset samples are the aforementioned images
that correspond to a view from a pin-hole camera with intrinsic parameters $\mathcal{I}$ (same for the whole dataset).
The camera is placed on a sphere around the scene,
up-vector is always positive in $Z$ axis,
the orientation is always aimed to the center of the scene.
The position of the camera is described with two angles: azimuthal angle $\theta$ and inclination angle $\phi$.
For each view the values of $(\theta, \phi)$ are sampled uniformly on the surface of the sphere.
In the experiments the inclination angle is bounded between $-10$ and $80$ degrees.
Camera extrinsics (in form of transformation matrix) are exported for each dataset sample along with the HDR image.
Additionally to that the bounding box is also exported as it is required
to initialize the octree for the NSVF method and all of the proposed methods as well.
$200$ sample images are used in datasets with 'static' and 'colocated' light settings.
For the 'arbitrary' light setting each dataset consists of $500$ sample images
for having more dense light-view sampling distribution.


\subsection{Light settings}

Different light settings are required due to a diversity of tasks that different methods are to solve.
The illumination of the scene is set using point light source.
The intensity of the light source varies for different scenes and is chosen empirically.
The positioning of the light source is performed according to the chosen light setting.
Three different light settings are used in order to create three versions of each dataset.
This is done based on the fact that different methods can only handle datasets with different settings:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Static setting}
    
    In this case the light source positioned at the same global location for all of the dataset samples.
    This allows to produce renders of the scene with static illumination.
    The motivation for this type of datasets comes from the limitation of the NSVF method
    as it does not imply dynamic illumination.
    Datasets with static setting are made for 'Vanilla NSVF' (\cite{liu2021neural})
    and can also be processed with 'Brute-force' (\Cref{sec:explicit_scheme})
    and both explicit and implicit schemes (\Cref{fig:implicit_scheme})
    with in-voxel approximation (\Cref{sec:invoxel}).
    
    \item \textbf{Colocated setting}
    
    This setting implies the light source to be co-located with the camera.
    In this case there is no displacement between camera and light source,
    which allows the NRF (\cite{bi2020neural}) approach to reuse the view volume transmittances
    in calculations as transmittances of the light rays.
    The 'Brute-force' scheme as well as both explicit and implicit schemes
    with in-voxel approximation are also able to be trained on this type of datasets.
    
    \item \textbf{Arbitrary setting}
    
    Datasets that have been created with this setting consist of renders
    where both camera and light positions are sampled uniformly on a sphere around the scene.
    The positioning of the light source follows the same scheme as for camera position.
    Another constraint is applied here that forces the angle
    between view and light rays to the center of the scene to be smaller
    than some value $\alpha_{max}$.
    In the experiments the value $\alpha_{max} = 120$ degrees has been used.
    
    This setting is focused on general case of the NRF approach
    and can be handled by proposed methods, such as: 'Brute force' scheme
    and both explicit and implicit schemes with in-voxel approximation.

\subsection{Scenes}

Creating the datasets from scratch is motivated by the fact that
vast majority of related works do not consider any light interaction.
This results in such a problem that the datasets that have been used in these works
do not include any necessary light information (global position).
Another limitation of these datasets is that the light source is static upon the dataset samples,
which results in a sparse light-view sampling of the scene.
Three different scenes have been used for the evaluation.
\im{reference figure to show this off - say about tonemapping}

\textbf{Sphere}

The \textit{sphere} scene consists solely of a sphere,
which shares Lambertian reflectance (\cite{blinn1982light}) with some specular and roughness components.
This scene is mostly used as a baseline as it is a very simple
both geometrically and in terms of appearance.

\textbf{Rocket}

The \textit{rocket} scene contains a single object,
which exhibits complicated geometry and realistic non-Lambertian materials.
This scene contains global geometry complications (rocket wings) and some fine details (rivets on the rocket shell).
The surface of the rocket shows moderate level of specularities (in comparison with sphere scene)

\textbf{Guitar}

The \textit{guitar} scene is created for testing models ability
to reproduce highly specular BRDFs.
Complex geometry also allows to asses how model handles geometrical features on different scales.
For example strings can be barely seen on renders and they would presumably the most troublesome geometrical part of the whole scene.



\subsection{Real-world dataset handling}

For the group of methods that only consider static illumination of the scene
the dataset acquisition can be performed in different ways.
One of these ways is to use a cell phone with its camera to capture the scene.
The acquired images can then be processed with such techniques as
structure-from-motion (\cite{Moulon2012}, \cite{Jancosek2011}, \cite{schoenberger2016structure})
in order to retrieve the camera intrinsics and extrinsics in correspondence with captured images.
Another way is to use some special hardware setups with calibrated camera positions
such as gonioreflectometers or e.g. x-rite tac7 (\cite{merzbach2017highquality}).

However, for the methods that model light interaction the light extrinsics information is lacking
when using the aforementioned techniques.
The acquisition of the dataset consisting of captures from real-world scenes
for this group of methods is a fairly hard task that cannot be performed without any hardware assistance.
Even for the 'colocated' case of the NRF method cellphones can only be used
together with the robotic arm holding the cellphone (\cite{bi2020neural}).

Another key point is the background that has to be as homogeneous as possible.
The quality of final renders are sensitive to the too complex background behind the object on the scene.

\section{Implementation details}

All of the proposed methods are implemented on Python
using PyTorch for neural fields and ray casting procedure.
During training $80$ pixels are first sampled from each of $1$ or $2$ images 
forming a batch that is used for one training iteration.
These pixels are used to cast rays through the principle points of the corresponding cameras.
These rays are then intersect the octree, which is initialized with $4^3$ voxels ($4$ voxels for each axis).
These rays are then being sampled on the intersection intervals with the step size $0.125$.
The following procedure differs depending on the method
and include additional light ray casting, intersecting and sampling for the 'brute-force' scheme and BRDF evaluation for the 'explicit schemes'.
Alpha compositing is performed after the color (or radiance) values are achieved.
These values are then being supervised with the ground truth values using fine-network term from loss function from the \Cref{eq:loss_func} with the beta-distribution regularizer from the \Cref{eq:beta_regularizer}:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L} = \sum_{(p_0,v)\in\mathcal{B}} \norm{ C(p, v) - C^*(p, v) } + \beta(\log(\tau_c(p, v)) + \log(1 - \tau_c(p, v))),
\end{equation}
with $\beta = 1e-3$ that is used in the experiments.

Adam optimizer is used as an optimization algorithm for learning parameters $(\Theta, I)$ ($I$ is light intensity value).
Learning rate for the optimizer is initialized with value $1e-4$
and polynomially decays to value $1e-6$ over 75k iterations.
Refinement procedure as well as reducing ray casting step are performed on iterations 5k, 25k and 50k.
Self-pruning is performed every 5k iterations.
Tone-mapping using scaling and gamma-correction (differ depending on scene)
is performed to visualize HDR images (both inputs and outputs).

All of the experiments are held on NVIDIA GTX 1080Ti GPU with 11GB of memory.
Dataset sample images are down-sampled to 256px x 256px to fit the GPU memory limitations.

\section{Metrics}

For evaluation of the results the following metrics have been used:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textit{PSNR} \cite{hore2010image} (Peak Signal to Noise Ratio) is a traditional estimator for image comparison
    that is based on MSE and concentrated on pixel-by-pixel comparison
    \item \textit{SSIM} \cite{zhou2004image}, \cite{nilsson2020understanding}, \cite{hore2010image} (Structural Similarity Index Measure) is a perceptual metric
    that assesses image quality based on perception of the human visual system.
    \item \textit{LPIPS} \cite{zhang2018perceptual} (Perceptual Similarity) is the metric
    that utilizes deep features of the pre-trained deep neural networks (Alex-net \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} in my experiments)
    to provide an evaluation that agrees well with humans' assessments.
    \item \textit{HDRFlipLoss} \cite{theisel2021hdrflip}, \cite{andersson2020flip} is the metric
    that is aimed to work with HDR images and produce better assessment comparing to other metrics
    that were originally designed to work with LDR images.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Experiments}

\im{Static datasets does not require light interaction for novel view synthesis since NSVF works pretty well.
However, it allows to also render novel-light-view images, which cannot be made using NSVF}

\im{Colocated datasets can be useful for comparison in-voxel approximation with NRF+NSVF (which is almost the same as brute-force scheme) approach}

\im{Random datasets: compare brute-force with in-voxel approximation}

% $L_i = \tau_l L_l$

% $L_l = f_{att}I$

% $f_{att}=\frac{1}{1 + 2d/r + d/r^2}$

% $L_o = \frac{k_d}{\pi} \frac{1}{1 + 2d/r + d/r^2} I cos \Theta_i$

% $k_c = 0, k_l = 0, k_q = 1$

% r = 0.05
